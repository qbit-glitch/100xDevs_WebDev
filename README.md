# 100xDevs Web Development

This repo contains a self-written course based on the `100xDevs Web Development Cohort 3.0` taught by Harkirat sir. Every sub-folder contains notes and codes along with diagrams based on the classes conducted.

NOTE: This repo is purely based on my learning and I'm not in sync with the live classes. Also I watch the recordings as per my own convinience whenever I get time coz I have to do my studies of M.Tech as well.
